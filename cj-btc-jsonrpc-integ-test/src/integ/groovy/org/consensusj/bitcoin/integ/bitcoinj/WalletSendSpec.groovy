 * Interoperability tests between a bitcoinj {@link Wallet} and a Bitcoin Core RPC server in RegTest mode.

 * This is a {@link Stepwise} Spock {@link spock.lang.Specification} meaning that the tests
 * are always run in the order they appear in the source file. {@link Shared} variables are initialized
 * in {@link WalletSendSpec#setupSpec}. Since these are integration tests (not pure unit tests) and
 * communicate with the stateful Bitcoin blockchain, the {@code Stepwise} approach is helpful.
