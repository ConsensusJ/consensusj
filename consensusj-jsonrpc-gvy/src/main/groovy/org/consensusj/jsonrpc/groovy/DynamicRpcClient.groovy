 * will result in an error from the server.
 *
 * The focus of RPC client development in bitcoin-spock has been strongly typed clients
 * the core of which is implemented in and can be used from pure Java. We also
 * believe that a strongly typed RPC client is the best choice for integration tests.
 * This client is provided for those looking for something simple, flexible, dynamic, and Groovy.
