== v0.4.0

Released: 2019.03.26

*bitcoinj* 0.15.1 and JDK 8+ everywhere!

=== Breaking Changes

Release 0.4.0 upgrades to https://bitcoinj.github.io[*bitcoinj*] 0.15.1 for all modules with *bitcoinj* dependencies. *bitcoinj* 0.15.x adds support for Segregated Witness and contains https://bitcoinj.github.io/release-notes#version-015[breaking changes].

Release 0.4.0 is also the first release where all modules requires JDK 8 or later.

Some classes and modules have moved to different Java packages.

=== consensusj-decentralized-id

*New, experimental module:* https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)], and specifically https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/[BTCR DID Method] support.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc

* Add proof-of-concept (https://www.graalvm.org[GraalVM]/SubstrateVM-compatible) JSON-RPC Server (Service Layer) support

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-cli

*New module:* a general-purpose (no Bitcoin or cryptocurrency dependencies or specialization) JSON-RPC command-line client with request and response logging. Can be compiled to a native command-line tool using the GraalVM https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/[native-image] tool.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-daemon

*New module:* https://micronaut.io[Micronaut]-based (and GraalVM/SubstrateVM-compatible) JSON-RPC sample ("echo") server.

=== cj-btc-daemon-mn

*New module:* https://micronaut.io[Micronaut]-based proof-of-concept Bitcoin JSON-RPC server. This will probably replace the Spring-based `bitcoinj-daemon` going forward because it is faster and smaller. It also offers the possibility of GraalVM native-compilation if we can massage **bitcoinj** itself to work when statically compiled.

* RPC client API, `setGenerate()` (also `generateBlock()`, `generateBlocks()`) when talking to `bitcoind` 0.9.x or earlier will return an empty list rather than `null`. If server is `0.10.x` or later, will return a list of `Sha256Hash`.
