== v0.7.0-alpha3

Released: 2023-10-05

This release includes significant updates the JSON-RPC client(s) and contains what should be relatively minor breaking changes.

=== JSON-RPC clients

* Upgraded to use `java.net.http` asynchronous client by default
* Async operation is now the default at the transport layer
* Asynchronous connection and "wait for server" logic
* Migrate "wait for server" logic from `BitcionCient` to `DefaultRpcClient`
* `DefaultRpcClient` replaces `AbstractRpcClient` and takes a configurable `JsonRpcTransport`
* Partial decoupling from Jackson JSON processor (see type parameter `T` in `JsonRpcClient<T>`)
* Remove deprecated methods that use `SSLSocketFactory` (In favor of `SSLContext`)
* Remove deprecated methods that use/return `NetworkParameters`.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-cli

* Is now built using Java and GraalVM 21.
* `--log=n` option to set log-level.

=== Reactive (Rx) Components

* Migrate from `Flowable` to `Publisher` where possible (breaking changes but easy to work around)
* Migrate from `Single`/`Maybe` to `CompletableFuture` in some (mostly internal) places
* `ChainTipPublisher` class help solves issues with erasure in generics and allow DI component constructors
  to take a `ChainTipPublisher` rather than `ChainTipClient`.

=== Reproducible/Deterministic build

* See https://github.com/ConsensusJ/consensusj/issues/17[Issue 17] and `release-process.adoc`.
* CI builds generate `SHA256SUMS` file for verification.

== v0.7.0-alpha2

Released: 2023-08-30

The 0.7.0 release of **ConsensusJ** will require **bitcoinj** v0.17, currently in alpha release. There will likely be multiple alpha releases of ConsensusJ as bitcoinj is updated.

=== bitcoinj-0.17-alpha2 update

* Upgrade to bitcoinj-0.17-alpha2 API
* More migration away from `NetworkParameters`

=== consensusj-jsonrpc

* JSON-RPC clients that need custom SSL behavior should implement the new constructors that take an `SSLContext` and stop using the deprecated constructors that use `SSLSocketFactory`.  (The deprecated constructors will be removed in the next alpha release!)
* Add (abstract) `sendRequestForResponseAsync` with async becoming the preferred way to implement this interface.
* Now that this module requires Java 11+, the _incubating_ `java.net.http`-based client `JsonRpcClientJavaNet` has been moved here. The `consensusj-jsonrpc-javanet` module has been removed. Feel free to try out this client instead of `JsonRpcClientHttpUrlConnection` and let us know how it works.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-javanet (removed)

This _incubating_ module has been removed. Its only class, `org.consensusj.jsonrpc.javanet.JsonRpcClientJavaNet` has been _moved_ to the `consensusj-jsonrpc` module (in the `org.consensusj.jsonrpc` package.)

If you are using `consensusj-jsonrpc-javanet`, you need to remove the `.javanet` from your `import` statements. You should also remove your Maven/Gradle references to the JAR/Module and replace them with references to `consensusj-jsonrpc`.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-cli

* `BaseJsonRpcTool` and `jsonrpc` tool use the `java.net.http` implementation (`JsonRpcClientJavaNet`) rather than the old `java.net.HttpURLConnection` implementation.


=== Dependency Updates

* Jackson 2.15.2
* Groovy 4.0.14
* RxJava 3.1.7
* JeroMQ 0.5.3
* Micronaut 4.0.5

=== Build/Test Updates

* Gradle 8.3
* GitHub JDK Matrix: Java 11, 17, **21-ea**
* GraalVM 17.0.7 (new release with new versioning scheme)
* Enable Dependabot

== v0.7.0-alpha1

Released: 2023-05-25

The 0.7.0 release of **ConsensusJ** will require **bitcoinj** v0.17, currently in alpha release. There will likely be multiple alpha releases of ConsensusJ as bitcoinj is updated.

=== bitcoinj-0.17 update

* Upgrade to bitcoinj-0.17-alpha1 API
* Migrate from `NetworkParameters` to `Network` where possible
* Remove usage of Guava `ListenableFuture`
* Remove `PatchedTransaction` class used to work around an issue in bitcoinj, see https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj/pull/2274[bitcoinj #2274]

with each release.

* Require JDK 9 (make use of `List.of()`)

** `cj-bitcoinj-util` (**bitcoinj** add-on Utilities)
* The following modules require Java 11:
** `consensusj-jsonrpc-javanet` (uses Java 11's `java.net.http`)
* The following modules require Java 17:
** `cj-bitcoinj-dsl-js` (Uses _unbundled_ Nashorn Javascript support)
** `cj-btc-services` (Intended for server-side usage)

=== Build

== v0.6.0

Released: 2022-07-25

=== Java Version upgrades

* JSON-RPC clients: Java 9
* JSON-RPC servers: Java 17
* CLI modules: Java 17

For details see https://github.com/ConsensusJ/consensusj#consensusj-modules[ConsensusJ Modules] in the README.

=== Java Automatic Module Name Support

* All libraries now have `Automatic-Module-Name` set in their JARs.
* Some packages were moved to (mostly) conform to the guideline of root package and module name being the same. Notably:
** `org.consensusj.bitcoin.rpc` -> `org.consensusj.bitcoin.jsonrpc`
** `org.consensusj.bitcoin.test` -> `org.consensusj.bitcoin.jsonrpc.test`
** `org.consensusj.bitcoin.rpc.groovy` -> `org.consensusj.bitcoin.jsonrpc.groovy`

=== Server-side JSON-RPC methods now return CompletableFuture

* `org.consensusj.jsonrpc.JsonRpcService.call(JsonRpcRequest)` now returns `CompletableFuture<JsonRpcResponse<RSLT>>`. This means all server implementations derived from this method were also updated.
* Corresponding changes in `consensusj-jsonrpc-daemon`, `cj-btc-json`, `cj-btc-services`, `cj-btc-daemon`.

=== consensusj-jsonrpc-cli

* Support parsing command-line arguments that are JSON strings.

* Add GraalVM support
* Add `help` and `stop` commands

=== cj-bitcoinj-util

* Continued development of transaction signer stuff classes (incubating)
* Updated BIP43 support (incubating)
